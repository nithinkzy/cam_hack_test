# Online Privacy Awareness Experiment

## Overview

This project aims to raise awareness about the potential risks associated with granting access permissions to unknown websites. It provides users with an opportunity to see a harmless demonstration of the type of data websites can access when granted permissions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to educate users about the importance of online privacy and the need to be cautious when interacting with websites that request access to various device features and personal data.

## How it Works

1. Users visit the website and are presented with a clear explanation of the experiment's purpose.

2. Users are invited to grant access permissions to the website, such as location, camera, microphone, etc., just as they would on many other websites.

3. Once permissions are granted, the website demonstrates what kind of data it can access without storing or using any user information. The user can see that the experiment is harmless and solely for educational purposes.

4. The project aims to illustrate the potential risks of granting permissions to websites and encourages users to think twice before doing so on unknown or untrusted sites.
